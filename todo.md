# Todo

Use cases:

1. User creates an entity - default form (usually empty)

2. User resumes the creation of an entity - load the saved form (values)

3. User edits an entity
3.1 clicks on edit button - the form pre-populates with the entity data _from the back-end_

4. User resumes to edit an entity
4.1 clicks on edit button - the form _should_ pre-populates with the entity data _from the back-end_
4.2 clicks on the browser's back button and navigates back to editing form - we should load the saved form in this case
  Problem - how to know if the user visited the form using the browser's back button?
