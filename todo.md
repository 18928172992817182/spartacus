# TODO

1. Having the "Edit Configuration" button on the cart page - customers would have specifically configure the configurable product in their catalog, and would see it only in that case.
    - it's not just one button, there's more to it - i.e. more elements present on the cart page
    - OrderHistory as well
    - checkout
