# Technical Changes in Spartacus 4.0

## Breaking Changes Introduced in 4.0

### ConfiguratorAttributeDropDownComponent

Method `onSelect` has been removed, it is no longer used. Use `onSelect` from super class which takes the value as argument

### ConfiguratorAttributeNumericInputFieldComponent

Method `createEventFromInput` has been removed, it is no longer used

### ConfiguratorAttributeRadioButtonComponent

Method `onDeselect` has been removed, it is no longer used

### ConfiguratorProductTitleComponent

Methods `getProductImageURL`, `getProductImageAlt` and `clickOnEnter` have been removed, there are no longer used

### Feature keys for product configurators

The feature keys that are used to lazily load the product configurator libraries in app.module.ts were available as `rulebased` and `productConfiguratorRulebased` from 3.1 onwards (respective `textfield` and `productConfiguratorTextfield` for the textfield template configurator).

In 4.0, only the longer versions `productConfiguratorRulebased` and `productConfiguratorTextfield` are possible.

Example: A configuration

      featureModules: {
        rulebased: {
          module: () => import('@spartacus/product-configurator/rulebased').then(
          (m) => m.RulebasedConfiguratorModule
        ),
        },
      }

needs to look like that in 4.0

      featureModules: {
        productConfiguratorRulebased: {
          module: () => import('@spartacus/product-configurator/rulebased').then(
          (m) => m.RulebasedConfiguratorModule
        ),
        },
      }
